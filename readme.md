Why did you choose Computer Science?

I didnt really choose the course Computer Science, when I tried applying for the UPCAT, unfortunately, I didnt take it that seriously because I thought my chances were slim and I wont get in anyway so I just chose a random course. That random course ended up to be Computer Science and I ended up actually liking it.
